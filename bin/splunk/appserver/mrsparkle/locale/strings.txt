# Static translation strings
#
# Place strings to be translated in here that don't otherwise live in a
# Python, html (template) or Javascript file
#
# i18n-extract.py will collect strings found here and add them to the 
# messages.pot file
#
#
# The format for this file is simply one string to be translated per line
# optionally preceded by a comment for the translator beginning with # TRANS:
#
# Plural versions of strings should immediately follow the singular version:
#
#   Delete %d file?
#   Delete %d files?
#
# There must be at least one blank line between translatable strings
# 
# Blank lines and other lines beginning with a # are ignored.

#   # TRANS: This is displayed as a warning on the file management page
#   Delete %s files?
