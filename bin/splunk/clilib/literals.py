ANONYMIZE_LONG="""
     Use anonymize to replace identifying data (usernames, IP addresses, domain 
     names, etc.) with fictional values that maintain the same word length and
     event type. Anonymizing data lets Splunk users share log data without 
     revealing  confidential or personal information from their networks.

     You can specify custom rules for Splunk's anonymizer by using the 
     parameters to specify your own word lists.

     Syntax:

        anonymize file -source [-parameter <value>]...

     Objects:

        source           relative or full path to file to anonymize

     Parameters: 

        public-terms     file containing a list of locally-used words to NOT anonymize
                         (default= $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/anonymizer/public-terms.txt)                  

        private-terms    file containing a list of words to anonymize
                         (default= $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/anonymizer/private-terms.txt)  

        name-terms       file containing a list of common English personal
                         names that Splunk uses to anonymize names with
                         (default= $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/anonymizer/names.txt)

        dictionary       file containing a global list of commonly-used 
                         words to NOT anonymize - unless they are in the 
                         private-terms file 
                         (default= $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/anonymizer/dictionary.txt)

        timestamp-config  file that determines how timestamps are parsed
                          (default= $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/anonymizer/
                          anonymizer-time.ini)

     Examples:

        ./splunk anonymize file -source /tmp/messages

        ./splunk anonymize file -source /tmp/messages -name_terms $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/Mynames.txt
        
        ./splunk anonymize file -source ../README-splunk.txt -name_terms ./etc/anonymizer/names.txt

"""

CLEAN_LONG="""
    The clean command deletes event data, global data, and user account data 
    from your Splunk installation. 
    
    Permanently remove event data from an index by typing, "./splunk clean 
    eventdata". Set the index parameter to delete event data from a specific 
    index. If you don't set an index, Splunk deletes all event data from all 
    indexes.

    Remove global data (tags and source type aliases for events you indexed) 
    from Splunk by typing, "./splunk clean globaldata".

    Remove user data (user accounts you've created) from Splunk by typing, 
    "./splunk clean userdata".

    ** Caution: **
    Removing data is irreversible. Use caution when choosing what data to 
    remove from your Splunk installation. If you want to get your data back, 
    you must re-index the applicable data sources.

    ** Note: **
    Add the -f parameter to force clean to skip its confirmation prompts.


     Syntax: 
        
        clean  eventdata [-f] [-index <name>]
        
        clean [globaldata|userdata|locks|all|deployment-artifacts] [-f]

                                      (only on advice of Splunk Support)
     Required Parameters: 

         eventdata     if no index specified, the default is to clean all 
                       indexes            

         inputdata     if no modular input scheme specified, the default is

"""

CLUSTER_LONG="""

	Clustering helps you setup cloned indexer configuration, to make computing, storage and networking resources more 
	robust to single node failure. A cluster would typically have a single master server and several peer servers. When one 
	of the peers goes down, the data on that node is available for searching on backup nodes(i.e. the other peers). Some of 
	the basic parameters that can be used to setup one such cluser are: 

	Parameters:

				          (can be configured only at the master) 
                 search_factor           Configures search factor ie number of searchable copies of each bucket

"""

OFFLINE_PEER="""

          Used to shutdown the peer in a way that doesn't affect existing searches. The master rearranges the primary peers for buckets, and actually 
	fixes up the cluster state as much as possible in case the enforce-counts flag is set. ie trying to maintain the replication and search factor
	for the cluster.
 
     Syntax: 
        
        offline [--flag]
        
     Required Parameters: 

	NONE

     Optional Parameters:

          auth       <username>:<password>
                       
     Flags:
	
	enforce-counts  If this flag is used, the cluster is completely fixed up before this peer is taken down.
		        ie the Replication factor and search factor for the cluster are honored to the maximum possible extent.

			Without this flag, the master will simple rearrange the primaries and timeout after 5 minutes(by default),
			The amount of time the master waits for the peer is configurable using the "restart_timeout" parameter using
			the "./splunk edit cluster-config" command. 

     Examples:

          ./splunk offline -auth admin:changeme

          ./splunk offline --enforce-counts

DISPATCH_LONG="""
     Searching with dispatch lets you run long-running reports via the CLI. 
     Use dispatch to search a large number (or unlimited) number of results to
     process a report. Searches run using dispatch are only limited by the 
     parameters you set (maxout or maxtime). You can set when to end a 
     dispatched search by setting a maximum time (maxtime) or a maximum number
     of results to output (maxout).

     ** Note: **
     dispatch uses the same syntax as the search command.  


     Syntax:

       dispatch "search string" [-parameter]


     Objects: 

       search string     String to search and report on.


     Required Parameters:

       NONE


     Optional Parameters: 

       maxout     Set the maximum number of results to return from the search
                  string (default=100)
       maxtime    Set the maximum number of seconds to run the search 
                  (default=0 or no limit)


     Examples:

    Supported flags and arguments:

    audit-keys: Generates a public and private authentication key.

          Supported flags:

AUTH_LONG="""

    Add the parameter "-auth username:password" to authenticate in line with 
    execution of any command.  

    Note: You can't use "-auth" with the "login" command.

    Note: Once you are logged in, your credentials are cached; you do not need to supply
        the '-auth' parameter again, until you invoke 'splunk logout', or the period given in
        server.conf/[general]/sessionTimeout has elapsed.

    Note: In offline mode (i.e. you are giving CLI commands from console of the host where Splunk is
        installed, *and* splunkd is not running), you do not need to supply the '-auth' parameter.
